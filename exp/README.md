# Experimental Programs

Here you can find various programs demonstrating technologies and behaviors used in the u-iot libraries.

* `multicast` - Go and Python chat programs that use UDP multicasting to send and receive messages. Used to familiarize myself with networking and multicast syntax in the two first u-iot libraries.
* `grpc` - Go program that uses our [`protocol buffers`](proto/) and gRPC in tandem with multicasting to demonstrate a stripped down bootstrapping process that will be used in u-iot. This program was a proof-of-concept, many of the demonstrated interfaces are likely to change.
